## Server Installation

To set up all the necessary components for the OpenRealms server, run the following command in your terminal. This command will download the installation script, execute it, and prompt you to accept the Minecraft EULA.

**Important Security Note:** Always review the content of scripts before running them directly from the internet.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRealms-MC/OpenRealms/main/setup.sh)"
